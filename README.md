# BurgerStream
A side project to further my understanding of Angular + Spring boot full stack development

## Backend application
To start up the back end application.

Copy the content of "application-example.properties" in "../BurgerStream/burgerstream-backend/src/main/resources
into a application.properties file (or rename the example).

Fill out your MySQL username and password and port if it is different from the default one.

Then run BurgerstreamBackendApplication file.

Once running, the API is accessible at:
"http://localhost:8080/api/v1/BurgerStream/"  
Example of endpoints include: "/menu/items", "orders" and "/menu/sizes."
